BUILD YOUR OWN

The thing with modular systems is you can sort of do whatever you want, so my goal here is to help guide a build and get you what you need without requiring a ton of research, but also leave it open-ended enough to work for your needs.

MAIN QUESTIONS

- how much cooling power do you want / need
- what's your tolerance for noise
- what's your budget

Like that classic "pick two" triangle, these are sort of the three main options.

a fourth might be

- do you want / need the loop to be smart enough to regulate itself to a certain temperature, or are you okay just figuring out what settings you like and leaving them there? we can save some costs if you're happy to play around over a few nights and realize "okay, I like 40% fan speed" and it just runs constantly at that rate all night instead of having a thermostat.

THE SHOPPING LIST OF THINGS YOU ALWAYS NEED

- some pump
- some radiator
- some reservoir
- some pipe / tubing
- some fittings to connect tubes to hardware
- some fan(s)
- some power supply
- some mattress cooling pad
- some fluid

and then think about:

- how is the pump controlled
- how are the fans controlled

THE COMPLETELY HIGH END BUILD

Basically what I ended up building.

- D5 NEXT pump computer
- triple radiator
- arctic P12 fans
- the fancy modular reservoir and pump hat
- PC power supply (will replace mine eventually with a 12V brick)
- 100% copper


THE MORE PRACTICAL VERSION OF THE BEST BUILD

- D5 NEXT pump computer
- double? single? radiator
- arctic P12 fan(s)
- integrated pump-reservoir saves costs and space
- 12V power supply


MEDIUM ALL-ROUNDER VERSION

- D5 Vario (no computer, but you set the percentage of power with a little dial and leave it)
- double or triple radiator
- some mid-level fan (P12s aren't that expensive, so for the noise I'd still suggest them always?)
- I need to find or build a fan controller for this setup
- integrated pump-reservoir


JUST COOL ME FOR CHEAP

- maybe that integrated DDC aquacomputer?
- double rad
- some mid-level fan (P12s aren't that expensive, so for the noise I'd still suggest them always?)


JUST COOL ME FOR EVEN CHEAPER

- some integrated DDC pump [like this](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32854766210.html) 
- whatever cheap aluminum radiator [maybe this](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/866247975.html)
- whatever cheap fan (the above comes with one, it's probably crap)
- I need a fan / pump controller here
- source a PVC mattress pad from aliexpress


THE DIRT CHEAP SCROUNGER

- DIY pop bottle reservoir
- $20 amazon aquarium pump
- cheap aluminum radiator
- find some old PC fan in the Staples electronic recycling bin
- aliexpress PVC mattress pad
- no fan / pump controller, you just plug them in and they run at whatever they run at
