Prototype cube (storage crate from ikea). basically just a frame to ziptie all the pieces to.

that's a full PC power supply which I just happened to have kicking around and it already worked for the plugs that the PC-based pump used, so that was an easy way to get up and running - the pump actually only uses ~10 watts and so having a 550W power supply is clearly overkill. By coincidence, this power supply has a eco mode where the fan doesn't spin so it's perfectly quiet which is conveniently great.

eventually I think I'd solder some sort of barrel connector to a cheap amazon 12V power supply brick, since that's more appropriate in power and size.

clearly there's lots of room here to make things more dense for more permanent install, I think I might drill a hole in my bed frame such that I can mount everything directly into / under the bed itself.

I used a sponge to hold up the acrylic pump hat because the bracket on the 'bottom' of the pump wasn't strong enough to cantilever both the pump AND a weighty block (and pipes, fittings, water weight) plus I figure it isolates vibrations and thus noise, if there's any (the pump runs very smooth and quietly)

The screen has tons of diagnostic info, and is a self contained operating system so you can adjust the thermostat settings, speeds, etc. - basically the whole reason I bought this particular pump is that I wanted the screen and fan controller.

these have worked great, no leaks that I can tell. cheap resin 3D printer used was the Elegoo Mars.
