Watercooling things already exists, so I wanted to start there and not re-invent the wheel.

My initial shopping list is this:


PUMPS

- D5T VARIO pump
- Aquacomputer D5 NEXT

MISC

- Alphacool Cape Corp Coolplex HF metall 25 reservoir
- Alphacool HF D5 TOP - Plexi G1/4 - (VPP655/TPP644/MCP655) V.2
- DarkSide - Triple LP360 Extra Slim Radiator
- Arctic P12 PWM fans (x3)
- Noctua NA-FC1, 4-Pin PWM Fan Controller

PIPES AND FITTINGS

- DarkSide 3/8"ID - 5/8"OD Straight Compression Fitting (x6)
- Ultra Clear Tubing (3/8 - 5/8) 10/16mm Tubing (10 feet)

And I'm using a PC power supply for now because that happens to be easy and stable for bench testing. Eventually I'll choose a 12V / 5V power adapter and solder whatever end is required onto that, depending on the pump and system chosen.

The other big big one here is that I'm using my existing Chili mattress pad for the actual mattress side interface. I'm not a huge fan of it, it's an older design, so I'm curious to buy one of the newer ones and see if they're more recommendable and/or design my own in a DIY fashion such that we don't need to buy them at all. The good news is, you can buy the mat without buying the unit so they are just an off-the-shelf part like any other, if at the expense of being part of their proprietary system pricing.

I also intend to 3D print some custom fittings as a go-between of the proprietary plumbing and the generic PC 10/16mm tubing. I think these spurs exist if you go to any hardware store and just cut the head off / ziptie fittings directly into the existing tubes. I happen to have a printer and I'll upload any 3D models I make, but I don't think it's a requirement.

I bought too much stuff in an effort to tinker, this wouldn't be the list I'd recommend as essential shopping for anyone trying to build their own just yet.

The main design consideration right now is in the brains of the unit.

I chose the D5 NEXT because it has a temperature sensor built in, and a little screen and buttons and everything to define both fan and pump curves based on temperature - this seemed ideal as a way to never have to build or program my own. You can also plug it directly into your motherboard and program the unit with an app on your computer, and it'll hold those settings after it's removed. Maximum flexibility and intelligence, it's seemingly the most expensive pump out there, but it also does _everything_.

You can see I also bought a Noctua fan controller with the idea that if I used the Vario pump (same pump physical design, it just has a little dial for pump speed instead of a computer) that I could also have a little dial for the fan speeds. This is the dumbest way of making a cooler: I guess you would find a speed for the fans and the pump that results in pulling an equal amount of heat away from you that you desire, and just leave it there forever. Not a _great_ system, but the pump is half the price. I'm not sure if I'm convinced the savings are worth it, but I haven't tried that system yet.

QUESTIONS STILL TO ASK:

- do I need a triple rad? would a double or even a single work? The price difference isn't _too_ big, but saving a bit there and also in fans is nicer, why not. The existing Chili design has a heatsink and not a true radiator so it's probably too inefficient to even quote in rad size terms (hence the need for way too much fan) but the idea generally is that more rad = more cooler @ lower fan speed. More surface area is more passive is more quiet, and for +$20 I don't mind that trade. Keep in mind that a human puts out ~100 watts of heat if we were to use computer equivalency terms, so we're basically one mid-grade processor of cooling loop requirements, and traditionally that doesn't require much radiator.

- there's a whole cheaper design family of pump called DDC. They're supposedly louder, but at this point everything is SO quiet that maybe "louder" compared to that doesn't even matter. Also, we can actually enclose the pump entirely as long as the radiatior is outside so maybe pump sound is the easiest possible part of this to deal with if the costs can come significantly down.

- there's also this pump: https://modmymods.com/aquacomputer-aquastream-ultimate-version-41108.html which comes with the exact same brain as the D5 NEXT but with a different pump and it includes what would be the D5 hat (you just connect tubes directly), so you effectively 1/3 the pump cost. I don't know anything else about it, though. 

- the Aquacomputer stuff seems low volume / constantly sold out, so maybe that's merely a problem with recommending.
