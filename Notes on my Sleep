NOTES ON MY SLEEP / THE BUILD

- I seem to prefer the mattress temp to be about 25-26°C. Unintuitively, this actually means that my unit tries to _heat_ my bed before I get into it, because the native room temperature is about 20-23°. But then I get in and I'm 36° so then it has to cool down to 26°. It would be more efficient if it was smart enough to let me warm it up to 26° and not add heat of its own.
- On that note, you dear reader might notice that my design has no heating unit. This could be added, but personally isn't my goal. I have no interest in warming my bed really ever. Maybe this is an oversight, we'll see if people keep asking for it. In my mind heating by any other means is incredibly easy, and cooling is relatively hard, so the invention is to solve the hard one.
- My ideal room temperature is about 17°. I love winter.
- Since moving to a place with central A/C it seems like I can sleep up to about 21° but 20° (real room thermometer, not thermostat number) is roughly the threshold where I start waking up and feeling hot and antsy. I also keep an overhead fan on medium, the breeze helps a lot.
- I do slowly acclimatize - the numbers in august are slightly different than june, with more tolerance having gotten used to summer. Then, by the time I'm happy in september, it's already starting to get cold again.
- Solar gain still is the biggest bane of room heating, both physically and perceptually. The other summer in my other place I was shocked to notice that my bedroom was 26° and I was rather comfortable as long as the blackout blinds kept the whole place as dim as possible. Bright and hot feels warmer than dark and hot?
