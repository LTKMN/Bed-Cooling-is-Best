CHILICUBE / PERFECT SLEEP


The one I own and started with is from [Perfect Sleep](https://www.perfectsleeppad.com/), on account of official brand Chili products not being shipped to Canada anymore. Something about warranty and repair / returns across the border, it was just easier for them to close the northern market.

The Perfect Sleep guy appears to just be one dude who also owns an organic health food store and sells these on the side because no one else in Canada is. Basically dropshipping before that was a real thing, the origin of the package was how I even discovered these facts.

The product itself seems very similar to / just a whitelabeled version of this [Aliexpress version](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Water-Thermostat-Cooling-And-Heating-Mattress_1688102616.html) for less than half the price.

It seems like there was a product schism at some point where Chilicube started a new generation (or stopped whitelabeling the generic one with the handle?) to start / focus on their eponymous cube-shaped generation. I think that's how the Canadian ended up selling that form factor, is because Chili didn't want to deal with Canadian shipping for warranty claims and returns, and so just pulled out of the market entirely when they switched. None of this really matters to us.

It's mediocre. I've described in other threads about the whining sound it makes, the cheap fans, etc. But, at the Aliexpress price at least, it's a pretty cheap option for something off the shelf and easy to run.

I chatted with the owner once, trying to bulk-buy the mattress pads themselves (the only thing that's tricky to source parts-wise), but the prices weren't too attractive. I'm not sure if he's just protecting huge margins, or his costs themselves are that high, but buying 10x at a time for increasing my local tests or reselling them myself he was only willing to do a small discount. This remains the hardest part to find.


EIGHT SLEEP

The upscale version. [Their pad](https://www.eightsleep.com/product/pod-pro-cover/) is $1750 and is clearly marketing themselves to the upper class Peloton crowd. "Elite performance for your sleep" and so on. That's cool. I just think it's out of reach for most, and there's seemingly nothing physically better to differentiate their product - we know we can buy top-tier hardware for a couple hundred bucks, so their COGS can't be that high. Nice margins, I assume.

I'd be really curious to try it out, specifically their mat looks nicer. I'm told the app isn't too great, but as far as I know they're the only ones who even have an app, so that's _something_. They're trying to do smart controls and responsive temps to keep you in a good sleep zone, which is the goal.

I totally think we could do exactly this but for $500 instead. Flashy branding is the easy part.
