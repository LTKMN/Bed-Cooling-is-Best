The one I own and started with is from [Perfect Sleep](https://www.perfectsleeppad.com/), on account of official brand Chili products not being shipped to Canada anymore. Something about warranty and repair / returns across the border, it was just easier for them to close the northern market.

The Perfect Sleep guy appears to just be one dude who also owns an organic health food store and sells these on the side because no one else in Canada is. Basically dropshipping before that was a real thing, the origin of the package was how I even discovered these facts.

The product itself seems very similar to / just a whitelabeled version of this [Aliexpress version](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Water-Thermostat-Cooling-And-Heating-Mattress_1688102616.html) for less than half the price.

It's mediocre. I've described in other threads about the whining sound it makes, the cheap fans, etc. But, at the Aliexpress price at least, it's a pretty cheap option for something off the shelf and easy to run.
