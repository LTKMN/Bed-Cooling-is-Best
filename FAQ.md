## Can I buy one yet? 

As of yet, no, but I am testing options and making a shopping list that I feel more confident telling people to go buy, and a guide on how to put it together.

I'm not actually sure if this is something I can bundle and sell as a competitor or what. If you'd like to help champion this project for profit and fame, do reach out.

## What's the DIY price looking like?

Existing products start at $500 so that's the rough goal, but I suspect we can actually build a much better thing for the same or less money, even without any bulk discounts or group buying this seems pretty feasible with off-the-shelf parts.

There's a bunch of options too: do you want the most convenient package, are you willing to get into arduino stuff and comfortable soldering some wires together for a sensor cable? would you pay for a completely inaudible pump vs a just-very-quiet one?

So I think somewhere in all of this there should be a choose-your-own-adventure for putting one together based on how nerdy you want to get and what your personal goals are.

AND, I still think I can pare things down a bunch even knowing what I know now in the first couple days of testing - I think triple radiators are way overkill for example, it seems I can sleep with the fan threshold set to 26째 and a room temp of 22째 and not actually turn them on much at all. That delta is almost completely passive for me under a duvet. So saving cost on smaller, cheaper rads, only buying one fan instead of 3, etc. Combining the pump and res into one of those combo units also seems cheaper, especially if you just want a Vario pump instead of the NEXT because those are sold as actual bundles. 

## Wouldn't a system like this just warm up your bedroom?

Yes it would, every joule of energy you take out of the bed goes into the air. But unless your room temperature is at or above your body temperature (~37째C, ~99째F), that's fine since the entire goal is to cool your body and not the air. But the real answer is that a human is putting out the same amount of heat energy just by laying there sleeping anyway, we heat up every space we exist in a little bit all the time - the loop isn't really heating the net bedroom system any more than we already are, we're just taking the energy away from the mattress where it gets trapped and is least comfortable to sleep.
