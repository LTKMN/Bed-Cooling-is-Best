# Frequently Asked Questions

## Can I buy one yet? 

As of yet, no, but I am testing options and making a shopping list that I feel more confident telling people to go buy, and a guide on how to put it together.

I'm not actually sure if this is something I can bundle and sell as a competitor or what. If you'd like to help champion this project for profit and fame, do reach out.

## What's the price looking like?

Existing products start at $500 so that's the rough goal, but I suspect we can actually build a much better thing for the same or less money, even without any bulk discounts or group buying this seems pretty feasible with off-the-shelf parts.

## Wouldn't a system like this just warm up your bedroom?

Yes it would, every joule of energy you take out of the bed goes into the air. But unless your room temperature is at or above your body temperature (~37°C, ~99°F), that's fine since the entire goal is to cool your body and not the air. But the real answer is that a human is putting out the same amount of heat energy just by laying there sleeping anyway, we heat up every space we exist in a little bit all the time - the loop isn't really heating the net bedroom system any more than we already are, we're just taking the energy away from the mattress where it gets trapped and is least comfortable to sleep.
