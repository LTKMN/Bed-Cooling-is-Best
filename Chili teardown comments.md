CHOOSING MY PARTS

In the teardown of the 'real' hardware (https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/ChiliTechnology+ChiliCube+Teardown/61640), we find a bunch of interesting things:

![image of fan](https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/W436HTeU6ZGASVZe.medium)

The cheapest PC fan known to man. You can see the blades run parallel to the arms, which creates a buffeting sound - quieter performance fans will curve the blades to reduce that parallelism and counter-rotate the arms altogether.

Here's a shot of the pump, model FS7341803H. There's an alibaba link that appears to not work. Conveniently they spec the head and flow right on the sticker there: 2.2m and 6L/min. Our pumps, the D5 family, are rated for 3.7m at 100%, which is why we can run them at like, 40% power and still get strong flow + less watts / less sound / less cavitation.

You can see the "radiators" aren't actually radiators but heatsinks, and just dreadfully cheap extrusions at that. I'm not shocked that we would see immense efficiency out of merely using proper rads. I might have fully overspec'd this plan with the triple.

My goal with everything is to spec it higher and then run it lower. If the radiator is truly too efficient, maybe we just don't run the fans. Maybe the pump runs at 10% power. Maybe the whole thing runs on a minimum floor and I just keep paring it down and down in costs until it makes sense.

Even at what I'd consider minimum costs, my $10 premium fan is infinitely quieter than whatever 90's Dell computer they pulled theirs out of and suddenly that difference becomes the best $9.50 you could ever spend.

Considering their unit is $500 at the lowest end, I'm not really sure where that money is all going.
